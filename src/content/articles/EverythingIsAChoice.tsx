        <Text style={p}>I want to talk about choice.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Specifically, how it relates to the Five Fundamental Principles of
          NeverFap.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The first principle that I almost always introduce to people is{' '}
          <Text style={{ textDecorationLine: 'underline' }}>
            Choice over mind
          </Text>
          , because it is the one principle that most porn addicts (usually)
          find the most profound.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Choice over mind relates to this idea that we have full control over
          how we react in life.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s an important concept to understand, because once you fully
          embrace the power of choice in life, you can learn to overcome
          life&rsquo;s most difficult challenges.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, assuming you put in the required practice.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In this article I want to help you better understand where you may be
          misunderstanding this idea of choice.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because if you truly understood the power you currently have to change
          as an individual, you most likely wouldn&rsquo;t be on this website.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So let&rsquo;s consider this your formal re-education.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>What is choice?</Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          It begs to state that everything in life is a choice.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          There&rsquo;s choice in how we feel. Choice in what we want to think.
          Choice in how we live, and what we want to eat.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In fact, there&rsquo;s choice in almost everything that happens in
          life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And yet, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that we necessarily get to choose all
          these things.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We don&rsquo;t get to choose our race. We don&rsquo;t get to choose
          how others live their lives. Hell, we certainly don&rsquo;t get to
          choose what the weather will be that day.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>And that&rsquo;s okay.</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Because I'm here to tell you that none of this matters.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You do have one choice which is so powerful that it effectively
          overrides every other choice in your life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In part, because it is the only choice you truly have control over.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>You get to choose how you want to respond.</Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          And it&rsquo;s a choice which overrides every other choice imaginable.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re already aware of this fact. I
          mean, obviously you have the ability to react to life&rsquo;s
          circumstances.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Yet perhaps you don&rsquo;t quite understand the significance of what
          this actually means.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Perhaps you&rsquo;re misinterpretating what having this choice allows
          you to do, so let&rsquo;s explore that idea.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          When you truly understand what{' '}
          <Text style={{ textDecorationLine: 'underline' }}>
            Choice over mind
          </Text>{' '}
          means, it completely changes the way you look at things.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You no longer become victim, or rather you realise that you never were
          victim, over that which you cannot choose.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So what does it being able to respond actually mean?
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Put simply, your ability to respond is the most powerful choice you
          have, because it is the only choice you as an individual can actually
          make.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          At no point do you have absolute certainty over any outcome in life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Instead, what you do have is absolute certainty over your actions, and
          this is quite profound for a few reasons.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          If your ability to respond is the only true choice that you have, then
          it signifies that you have full control over your life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because response happens through actions, and actions are the only
          means through which we can change as human beings.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4} />

        <Text style={h4}>
          Which really is to say that you have full control over who you want to
          become.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          In addition, it also signifies that we are all equal in terms of our
          ability to take action.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is to say that we all have that exact same opportunity to
          become, because we all have the same ability to take action.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          From this point of view, everything we are today can be viewed as a
          sum of our actions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          From a potential point of view, we really are no different.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We both have the exact same potential to respond on a low level with
          our thoughts and emotions.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          The only difference between you and me is in the actions that we've
          taken over time.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is to say that if you responded in the same way that I did, then
          you also would not be a porn addict.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>Success and your actions</Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          The important thing to understand about success is that it
          doesn&rsquo;t happen at a high level.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>It happens on an emotional and physical level.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Success is the difference between choosing to remain calm in a tense
          situation, as opposed to losing our cool.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Success isn&rsquo;t about being wealthy or driving a fast car.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Success is about having control over our feelings and emotions, so we
          feel indifferent about how much money we or anyone else has.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In the context of porn addiction, success is acknowledging that our
          cravings for porn are merely habitual, and not to be taken personally.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Success is meditating daily so that we can learn the skills to
          properly address our porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Remember.</Text>

        <View style={hr4} />

        <Text style={h4}>
          The only difference between someone who has successfully overcome porn
          addiction and someone who continually fails, is that the person who
          overcame porn addiction took the right actions to get there.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Porn addicts really are no different from each other.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Every porn addict goes through the same feelings and emotions of
          helplessness, guilt and depression.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The only difference is in how they choose to respond to these feelings
          and emotions, so they don&rsquo;t let them dominate their life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Now, I&rsquo;m not suggesting that you&rsquo;ll be able to face these
          feelings and emotions by merely being aware of them.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          However, what I am suggesting is that with the right guidance and
          practice, you can develop the ability to be able to.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

          your life.
