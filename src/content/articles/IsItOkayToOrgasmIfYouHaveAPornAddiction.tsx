          "Is it okay to orgasm if you have a porn addiction?"

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Whenever asking these kinds of questions, it can always help to come
          back to The Five Principles Of NeverFap.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And this particular question primarily relates to{' '}
          <Text style={{ textDecorationLine: 'underline' }}>
            Struggle over none
          </Text>{' '}
          and how orgasming affects our ability to overcome porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Personally speaking I do not think it&rsquo;s okay to orgasm if you
          have a porn addiction and I&rsquo;ve even taught myself not to orgasm
          during sex, so it&rsquo;s a guiding principle I take quite seriously.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Essentially, the reason why I don&rsquo;t orgasm is quite simple.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4} />

        <Text style={h4}>The act of orgasming messes with your emotions.</Text>

        <View style={hr4__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          At the end of the day, I don&rsquo;t particularly care about the
          philosophical, nor even the moral arguments behind watching porn, nor
          even abstaining from it.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Ultimately I&rsquo;m a processes kind of guy, which means I care
          solely about the easiest and most efficient way to achieve something.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So with this in mind, orgasming simply makes it harder to overcome
          porn addiction, whether it&rsquo;s to porn or not.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Whenever you orgasm you still experience that intense dopamine rush
          which more-or-less makes regulating your emotions impossible.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And as I state on this website, 5% of your time should be spent
          practicing Healthy Coping Mechanisms, while the other 95% of your time
          should be spent remaining calm and relaxed.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Certainly, it's incredibly difficult to remain calm and relaxed after
          an orgasm.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Especially if you&rsquo;ve been abstaining for weeks on end, as well
          as avoiding any kind of stimulus.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It will hit you like a train, and your emotions will suffer big time.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s the same reason why you also shouldn&rsquo;t binge eat
          carbs or take copious amounts of drugs on a daily basis.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It makes it incredibly difficult to regulate your emotions in regards
          to the dopamine response that ensues.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Orgasming, something which produces an excessive amount of dopamine -
          really is no different.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You can sell it however you want as something that&rsquo;s inherently
          &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;porn-free&rdquo; and therefore okay.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          However so was excessive war and smoking at one point in human
          history, so I don&rsquo;t think these kinds of personal expectations
          based on the standards of society are valid.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          At the end of the day, you&rsquo;re going to have a much easier time
          overcoming your porn addiction by refraining from these behaviours in
          general.

        <Text style={p}>
          What{' '}
          <Text style={{ textDecorationLine: 'underline' }}>
            Struggle over none
          </Text>{' '}
          describes is that everything we do should make overcoming our porn
          addiction easier, not harder.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Furthermore, there&rsquo;s no reason at all why you should ever need
          to orgasm, even during sex.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          What NeverFap Deluxe is about instead, is developing control over your
          mind so that you have freedom over your life.

        <Text style={p}>
          So you don&rsquo;t feel as if you need to use porn, orgasm or
          masturbation as a form of release or self-expression.

        <Text style={p}>
          You can simply be thriving and happy, just the way you are.
