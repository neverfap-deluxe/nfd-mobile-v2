          The Easiest Way To Identify A Judgement

        <Text style={p}>
          Some people have a hard time identifying the judgements they make on a
          daily basis.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It could be because they judge out of habit and therefore are doing it
          subsciously without realising it, or perhaps because they&rsquo;re
          simply unable to recognise a judgement once they&rsquo;ve made one.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Certainly, I had no idea about the extent to which I was
          subsconsiously making judgements, and it took me years to personally
          identify them all and dissolve the negative habit for good.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, I&rsquo;m writing this article today so you can have a much
          easier time identifying the judgements you make on a daily basis, so
          you can live your life relatively burden free.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Essentially, it all comes down to a super simple technique we can use
          to instantly identify the judgements we make throughout the day.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And furthermore, it&rsquo;s a technique that doesn&rsquo;t require
          paying a therapist hundreds of dollars per hour for the privilege.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          The technique is to pay attention to your emotional reactions.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Your emotion reactions are a key indicator of whether you&rsquo;ve
          made a judgement or not, and in order to understand how this works, we
          need to understand what emotional reactions are.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For starters, emotional reactions don&rsquo;t simply appear out of
          thin air.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          They exist as a reaction to an event, usually in regards to a thought
          we have about something.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Enter judgements.</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          You see, judgements are much more than mere thoughts.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          If they were just like any other thought, then much like most other
          thoughts we have, they would disappear completely from our conscious
          never to bother us again.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, while most of us are unable to remember any thoughts or
          opinions we had of the weather more than a few weeks ago, let alone
          the day before.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Most of us can probably remember a time when our parents made us do
          something that upset us greatly, even if these events may have taken
          place more than a decade ago.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In essence, what makes judgements different is that unlike typical
          thoughts that come and go, judgements are thoughts that we have put
          significant faith into and belief into.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And it&rsquo;s this reason why they can be so destructive.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, a lot of us make the judgement that we&rsquo;re not good
          enough and that we should try harder as a result (also known as
          self-criticism).
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          And when we make these judgements, we dictate how we're going to react
          on an emotional level.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          We come up with these deterministic narratives like:
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          <b>
            &ldquo;If that person doesn&rsquo;t shut up, I&rsquo;m going to get
            so mad!&rdquo;
          </b>
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          <b>
            &ldquo;If I fail this test, I&rsquo;m going to feel so helpless and
            depressed.&rdquo;
          </b>
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In a lot of cases, we won&rsquo;t even necessarily vocalise these
          agreements and instead, we&rsquo;ll imply them in our actions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, we might get really tense when we&rsquo;re mad or
          stressed.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And what can happen over time is that we may not even generate the
          thought or physica response anymore, and simply skip straight to the
          emoiton.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, feeling sad because we don&rsquo;t have a girlfriend, or
          getting upset because things aren&rsquo;t going our way.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Certainly, these hidden agreements form part of the reason why these
          judgements can be so hard to identify, because often they take place
          completely out of conscious sight.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Yet from the perspective of our emotional reactions, they are never
          hidden.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Because although these agreements and beliefs are often hidden, the
          direct effect of those judgements are fully felt via the emotional
          reactions which shut us down and hold us completely at ransom.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Via the emotional horror that pursues.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          This is when we feel the effect of those judgements most, and so
          paying attention to what you&rsquo;re feeling can be a key indicator
          as to whether you&rsquo;re making a judgement or not.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Only until we can identify these judgements through our emotional
          reactions, can we finally move on and learn not to react, instead
          choosing to remain calm and level-headed.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, you&rsquo;re probably wondering. I&rsquo;m making all these
          judgements, but what can I actually do about them?
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>How is identifying them going to help?</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Well, the great thing is that we don't need to go any further than
          simple acknowledgement.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Because anything further you do at this point, is unnecessary
          rationalisation which is the exact opposite of what we are trying to
          achieve, which is to learn to let go and remain relaxed.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Effectively, what we want to do is learn to let go of these
          judgements, and learn to simply function regardless of them.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Where people often go wrong is that they feel trapped once
          they&rsquo;ve identified these judgements, as if they&rsquo;ve done
          some great evil, feeling the need to dissect them or rectify these
          behviours and habits.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The funny thing is that this behaviour within itself is an emotional
          reaction, brought about by judgement. For example, you may have the
          judgement that you&rsquo;re not good enough, and therefore feel the
          need to do something about it.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          This in part signifies the extent to which a lot of the judgements are
          simply subconscious habit.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          As well as why it&rsquo;s important that we address these judgements
          and hidden agreements now, rather than let them continue to develop.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, many of us have been making these judgements since
          childhood, so it won&rsquo;t happen overnight.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Just remember that no matter our emotional reaction or judgement, our
          go-to response is to acknowledge that we&rsquo;ve experienced an
          emotional reaction due to judgement, and to simply move on.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Once you acknowledge something, not only does it help take you out of
          the reaction, which helps you in terms of remaining calm and
          refraining from reacting further.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          However it helps build your self-awareness and ability to identify
          these judgements in future.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Of course, like anything practice makes perfect.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And by using healthy coping mechanisms such as meditation and
          awareness exercises, we can go a long way towards developing control
          over our judgements and emotions.
