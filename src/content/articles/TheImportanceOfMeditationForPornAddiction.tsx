<Text style={p}>Meditation is the single most important thing you can do for your porn addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>In fact, ten minutes of meditation each day is probably enough for most porn addicts to overcome their addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>No, seriously.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It really is that simple.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, the reason why this doesn&rsquo;t happen is because most porn addicts are completely oblivious as to the benefits of meditation.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Not to mention, most porn addicts have a hard time sticking to a routine of meditation, which is entirely necessary in order for it to be successful.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is why the other 99% of this website exists, to help you understand why it&rsquo;s absolutely vital.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Why meditation?</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>Without diving too deep into the intricate details of how to meditate, nor necessarily what meditation actually is, let&rsquo;s start off by talking about what meditation effectively achieves.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In essence, meditation is the most powerful way for you to regain power over your emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Not just your emotions, but your thoughts, feelings and everything else associated with the inherent functioning of your brain.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Here&rsquo;s the deal, being a porn addict has changed the way your brain works.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s no longer stable.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s no longer doing exactly what you want it to.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>What meditation allows you to do is develop the ability to maintain control over your mind.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>So you no longer feel compelled to watch porn.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, porn may not even be the reason why you lack the ability to control your mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It may be that you never developed those healthy coping mechanisms growing up, and that it was inevitable you were going to be become addicted to porn or engage in other self-harming behaviour as a result.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, this is the category that most people fit into.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Meditation and Porn addiction</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>Overcoming porn addiction is actually a relatively straight-forward process.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It largely comes down to developing control over your emotions, as well as developing an understanding of how your mind works.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In terms of developing control over your emotions, it means practicing meditation on a daily basis so that you can remain calm and collected irrespective of what may be happening external to your mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In terms of understanding your own emotions, it&rsquo;s about having the capacity to not take your own emotions personally, and to remain calm when you feel as if your emotions are out of your control.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>If you can manage those two things, you'll more-or-less be 90% of the way there to overcoming your porn addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Yet most people struggle.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Precisely because they don&rsquo;t do those things.</Text>

<Text style={p}>They don&rsquo;t meditate on a frequent basis. They don&rsquo;t understand their emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>They don&rsquo;t know how to maintain control over their minds, and yet they wonder why they struggle.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This is precisely the reason why meditation is important, because it provides us with the ability to face these challenges without hesitation or fear.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>When you have control over your emotions, it makes situations where you don't necessarily feel in control manageable.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Yes.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Manageable.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because successfully overcoming porn addiction is largely about learning to navigate through your emotions, and manage them so that you can be in control of your desired outcomes.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And you can&rsquo;t manage your emotions if you don&rsquo;t have mastery over your mind, along with your ability to produce and regulate them.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So what exactly are some of the skills and practices of meditation?</Text>

<Text style={p}>For starters, there&rsquo;s observation.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Observation is perhaps the most fundamental skill you can learn in regards to developing your awareness.</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>It is the skill we will focus on and develop most throughout the practices here on NeverFap Deluxe.</Text>



<Text style={p}>In part, because it&rsquo;s really hard to take something personally or lose our frame of reference when we&rsquo;re merely observing reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>As opposed to being invested in it with our own personal beliefs, thoughts and judgements</Text>

<Text style={p}>Aside from observation, there is also introspection (our ability to look into ourselves), perspective (changing the way we think about things), as well as a whole range of different skills.</Text>

<Text style={p}>These skills are broken into Five Fundamental Principles which allow us to focus on particular outcomes related to overcoming porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I recommend checking out our list of NeverFap Deluxe Practices for a list of exercises you can do to develop awareness in your life.</Text>
