<Text style={p}>Let&rsquo;s discuss a NeverFap best case scenario.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Here are a list of metrics that reflect a very healthy attitude towards life.</Text>

<View style={hrul}/>

<View style={ul}>
<Text style={li}>You no longer watch porn.</Text>
<Text style={li}>You no longer crave watching porn.</Text>
<Text style={li}>Pornography isn’t something you ever think about, at all.</Text>
<Text style={li}>You no longer stare at women in public. You don’t even notice them.</Text>
<Text style={li}>You see women as other human beings, no more special than you.</Text>
<Text style={li}>You no longer judge other human beings, including yourself.</Text>
<Text style={li}>You have control over your mind and thoughts.</Text>
<Text style={li}>You’re conscious of your feelings and emotions.</Text>
<Text style={li}>You’re happy with yourself and accept every single aspect of who you are.</Text>
<Text style={li}>You’re comfortable with your emotions, both positive and negative.</Text>
<Text style={li}>You’re confident because you understand yourself.</Text>
<Text style={li}>You don’t engage in self-harm of any kind.</Text>
<Text style={li}>You’re motivated and ambitious.</Text>
<Text style={li}>You’re committed to your mental health.</Text>
</View>

<View style={hrul__bottom}/>

<Text style={p}>Fancy pants.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now go out there and buy yourself a Golden Globe.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You deserve it buddy, now that you fully understand exactly what you must achieve in life.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>If it weren't for the fact that lists like these are utterly meaningless.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Here&rsquo;s the deal.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We&rsquo;re not going to concern ourselves with goals and ideals.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead, what we&rsquo;re going to do is focus on hard processes and practices that will help us move forward.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>We're going to focus on the things we can do everyday in order to improve as a person.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Because at the end of the day, there are no such things as &ldquo;ideal outcomes&rdquo; or &ldquo;best case scenarios&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>They&rsquo;re merely predefined ideas which exist in our head.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Ideas which we use to judge ourselves, as a tool of comparison against these imaginary boundaries. A tool which neither contributes towards our mental health, nor empowers us in any way.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead, we need to recognise that there are only ever actions.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Actions which since you were born, have defined who you are today.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>And which will define who you will become tomorrow.</Text>

<Text style={p}>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re interest in. Movement, not ideas.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Movement is what helps us get to our destination, not describing what that destination ideally should be.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This is why much of the content on this website is built around verifiable practices, so that you can actively improve and make changes to your life on a regular basis.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Ultimately, there is only one rule of NeverFap.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Practice. Practice. Practice.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Consistent hard work and practice are the only ideals which you should strive towards.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Everything else is pure fluff, no matter how impressive it may sound in a list of glorified achievements.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because I can assure you that you don&rsquo;t overcome porn addiction by glorifying a list of ideals.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead, I commit myself to respecting fundamental principles. I work hard to practice my mental health on a daily basis, and I put in a lot of ground work to ensure that I can become a better person tomorrow.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And you know the best thing about focusing on your actions?</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>Everything just appears to work and come together, without you even having to worry about it.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>That is the magic of hard work and simplicity.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Put in the work and everything else will fall into place.</Text>
