        <Text style={h1}>The Five Fundamental Principles Of NeverFap</Text>
        

<Text style={p}>The NeverFap method of addressing porn addiction comprises of five core principles.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Each principle maintains a purpose, along with a range of associated skills which you must develop in order to successfully address your porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Without mastery of all five of these principles, we cannot hope to consistently manage the emotions, thoughts and  behaviours which may be contributing towards our porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For more of a relaxed introduction, I highly recommend reading my article The Five Principles Of Neverfap As They Relate To My Life which explains how they apply to my own life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Before we begin, we must ask ourselves a very important question:</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>What is a fundamental principle and what makes it fundamental?</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>A fundamental principle is a hard truth. It is something which remains true irrespective of whether you agree with it, how you feel about it, nor even how you understand or interpret it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It simply is.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You may attempt to dispute these fundamental truths or argue against their validity, which is perfectly fine if that is your intention.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However it certainly won&rsquo;t help you overcome porn addiction, which is the primary reason why you&rsquo;re here. You know, to receive help for a problem that you cannot do alone.</Text>

<Text style={p}>My intention on the other hand is very clear. I am here to help you overcome porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So in order to do this, we must first set some ground rules and truly understand exactly what we&rsquo;re getting ourselves into.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Ground rules</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>The key thing to understand about fundamental principles is that they are not subject to open-ended thinking.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example:</Text>

<View style={hrul}/>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>&ldquo;Well, my mind doesn&rsquo;t really work like that.&rdquo;</Text></Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>&ldquo;While that may be true, I don&rsquo;t personally allow it to affect me in that way.&rdquo;</Text></Text>

<View style={hrul__bottom}/>

<Text style={p}>This is not how fundamental principles operate.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Hard truths are not open to subjective questioning. Certainly, you&rsquo;re more than welcome to question them if you like, however it won&rsquo;t help you with your porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In fact, there&rsquo;s a very specific word that is used to describe when people refuse to accept the fundamental basis of reality.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>It's called denial.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Whether you realise it or not, the reason why you are a porn addict is because you are in denial about some aspect of your life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Perhaps it is a misunderstanding of what you are capable of as a human being. Perhaps you have a low opinion of your self-worth. Maybe you never had the chance to develop any healthy coping mechanisms growing up.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Ultimately, the aim of these five fundamental principles is to help you expose the fact that there is something wrong with the way you currently think.</Text>

<Text style={p}>As a former porn addict, I encourage you to embrace the idea that everything you know about yourself is wrong, and to not fight the unfamiliar.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You cannot get better if you cannot first recognise that you have a problem.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>On a superficial level, none of these principles seem to have anything to do with addressing porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, there is no fundamental principle along the lines of &ldquo;Never visit a porn website ever again&rdquo; or &ldquo;You should never willingly orgasm&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>A large part of the reason why this is the case is because porn addiction has very little to do with porn itself.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Rather, porn addiction is merely a symptom of a wider range of problems which NeverFap aims to address.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So without further ado, here are the five fundmental principles of NeverFap:</Text>


  <Text style={h2}>01 - Choice over mind</Text>


<Text style={p}>While all these principles are important in their own right, this is perhaps the one that people tend to struggle with most.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Or rather, it is a way of thinking and understanding which is completely foreign to most of us, and even those of us who do not have a porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Choice over mind</Text> iterates is the fact that you have complete control over your mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This is irrespective of whether you currently feel in control of your mind, whether you agree it&rsquo;s possible to have full control over your mind, or whether you&rsquo;ve even experienced having full control over your mind.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>What's important to understand is that your mind is fundamentally capable of being controlled.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>I would personally say that this fundamental principle is both equal parts understanding and practice.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly while practicing and exercising choice is important, understanding the extent to which we have choice will help us gain the confidence to truly feel comfortable dictating our thoughts, feelings, emotions and behaviour.</Text>

<Text style={p}>By in large, the way this confidence is achieved is through controlled meditation and perspective training, which is covered extensively throughout the NeverFap Deluxe Practices section.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, a situation where many porn addicts believe they do not have control is in public.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Many porn addicts (particularly male porn addicts) have a tendency to stare at women they find attractive in public. In particular, control over staring at hot women in public.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, I&rsquo;m here to tell you that with daily practice, we can learn to develop control over our mind, and completely filter the women we walk past in public altogether.</Text>


  <Text style={h2}>02 - Balance over reward</Text>


<Text style={p}>This is one of those concepts that people think they understand, and yet refutely misunderstand simply because of how obliviously unbalanced they are to begin with.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In fact, it&rsquo;s something most people outright ignore because they don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s &ldquo;that big of a deal&rdquo;, not quite understanding the consequences that ignoring balance can have on their life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In other words, denial.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Balance over reward</Text> maintains is this idea that we must prioritise balance over our immediate wants and goals.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Often we become so affixated with something, either through obsession or neglect, we fail to consider the wider ramifications of our actions.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>So we cut corners in order to achieve or experience what we want, only to face the consequences of our actions later.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Not realising that the reason why we&rsquo;re struggling is because of the corners that we&rsquo;ve cut.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, overworking ourselves is a prominent example of cutting corners in order to achieve something at the immediate harm to both our physical and mental health.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We stay up late to finish what we&rsquo;re working on, ruining our sleep schedule and ability to regulate stress. We most cases, resort to caffeine and porn to keep us energised, resulting in addiction and dysfunction.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>And yet, we're so focused on the outcome that we don't quite realise what we're even doing wrong.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Rather, we feel justified in our actions, inspite of the fact that we recognise that we may have a problem with addiction or our mental health.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Even though a) Cutting corners makes you less productive overall than if you were functioning normally and b) Having the added effect of ruining your mental health physical health in the process.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead, by learning to respect the principle of balance in your life, you can actually get more done overall without burning out, and without the constant baggage of emotional volatility and stress.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I think part of the problem is that people fall into the trap of believing they&rsquo;re inherently unique when it comes to cutting corners.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>They think they can somehow "cheat" the system and come out ahead.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Put simply, it&rsquo;s impossible.</Text>

<Text style={p}>No one is immune to their own biology.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Even though people may not show it (in most cases, they simply know how to hide it very effectively), there is a hard limit to what everyone can do on a daily basis without it affecting their mental health.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The point is that if we are to overcome our porn addiction, we must respect this limit and embrace balance in everything we do.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This means taking breaks, even when we want to push forward. This means challenging ourselves, even if we don&rsquo;t feel like it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And by learning to value and respect these boundaries, you may gain a significant amount of control over your life.</Text>


  <Text style={h2}>03 - Awareness over all</Text>


<Text style={p}>Awareness is absolutely fundamental to everything we do.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It is what allows us to identify and address the destructive patterns in our life, as well as serve as a stop-gap between our thoughts and our actions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Awareness over all</Text> maintains is that having awareness over our actions is critical to not only understanding the impact those actions may have over our own lives, but also how we can learn to gain control over them.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Without full awareness, we simply cannot hope to act with any amount of intention, nor understand the responsibility we have over them.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Instead, we allow our habitual thoughts, emotions and beliefs to take over and continue their self-destructive patterns.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>I think the reason why most people struggle with this concept of awareness is because:</Text>

<Text style={p}>a) They&rsquo;re not currently aware, nor understand how to be aware because it&rsquo;s not something they&rsquo;ve ever practiced.</Text>

<Text style={p}>b) Most people struggle to even understand what this concept of awareness actually is. (I was certainly one of them)</Text>

<Text style={p}>In reality, awareness is actually really simple.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Awareness is your ability to sense the world around you.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>That&rsquo;s literally it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s not about focusing your mind or trying really hard not to think, or even trying to figure out how to empty the thoughts in your mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, they may be useful skills and they may be a consequence of practicing awareness, however the actual action of awareness itself is simple.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>It is simply being present with your senses.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Pretty neat, huh?</Text>

<Text style={p}>And when you&rsquo;re present with your senses and what you&rsquo;re feeling, it provides you with the ability to control and gauge your experience.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Witout reaction, and without taking what you&rsquo;re experiencing it personally.</Text>


  <Text style={h2}>04 - Struggle over none</Text>


<Text style={p}>Essentially, the basis of this principle is that the simplest path is often the most efficient.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And as humans, we instinctly do what we find most simple, either for better or worse.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Therefore, solutions which are simple by design are going to be more effective than solutions which are convoluted.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s the reason why I personally follow the paleo diet and only eat one meal a day.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Doing this is vastly more simple than counting calories, obsessing over when I can eat and organising three meals a day.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In other words, simple is often easy.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Certainly, part of the reason why we're addicted to porn in the first place is because it's the easy thing to do.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Back to the principle itself, what <Text style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Struggle over none</Text></Text> relates to is this idea that if you&rsquo;re really struggling with someone, then you&rsquo;re probably not doing it right.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which means either you&rsquo;re not understanding it intuitively, or you&rsquo;re fundamentally misunderstanding what you&rsquo;re trying to understand.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, understanding that porn recovery isn&rsquo;t about fighting yourself or forcing yourself to &ldquo;get through it&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>If at any point you feel like you have to force yourself to do something, then it indicates that you&rsquo;re doing something incorrectly or more importantly, not actually recovering from porn addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Because life without porn isn't a struggle.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s actually one of the most liberating and empowering things you can do.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The takeaway being that life only ever becomes a chore when we act against it or neglect it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Especially when it comes to addressing porn addiction.</Text>


  <Text style={h2}>05 - Uncondition over judgement</Text>


<Text style={p}>Much like Balance over reward, this is one of those principles that people tend to ignore, because they underestimate the ramifications of ignoring it.</Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>Uncondition over judgement</Text> is about pursing acceptance over judgement.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>What a lot of people don't realise is that judgement is a mental trap.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Because when you make a judgement, you essentially trap yourself into a limited point of view.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, the reason why it may not seem like a mental trap is because at first, making one judgement isn&rsquo;t going to kill you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>But humans never just make one judgement.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We make thousands of judgements each and every day, each time moulding our perception of who we are and what we know.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And when we make enough of these judgements, they can form into habits of belief which prevent us from exercising awareness.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>After all, how can you be aware of what's going on in your mind, if your mind is in a constant state of habitual thinking?</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>The more judgements you make, the more awareness you trade, and the more faith that gets placed into ideas of who you are and what the world is.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It becomes a trap because without realising it, through judgement you end up in a state of habitual unawareness, full of harmful behaviours that we have no idea how to control or influence.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now imagine trying to address something like porn addiction under this state of mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It becomes almost impossible.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because guess what happens when you invest all your faith into a bunch of fruitless ideas?</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>You end up having no capacity to address the problems in your life which actually has meaning, like your porn addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Remember, there are consequences to everything you do in life, whether you realise it or not.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So there you go.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Hopefully you have a better idea of what the Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap are, as well as what they represent.</Text>

<Text style={p}>They exist to help guide you through your porn recovery journey, as well as help you make healthy decisions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>If ever you get confused about anything, it can help to come back to these five principles, or try to assess what you might be doing incorrectly.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Because at the end of the day, overcoming porn addiction is completely within your reach.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>You just have to know exactly what you&rsquo;re doing and why.</Text>
