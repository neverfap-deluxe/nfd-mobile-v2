        <Text style={h1}>What Makes NeverFap So Different</Text>
        

<Text style={p}>NeverFap Deluxe aims to be a comprehensive solution towards addressing your porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>While there are many resources out there on the internet which accurately describe what porn addiction is and how it functions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I couldn&rsquo;t find a single resource that could accurately tell me <Text style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>exactly what I needed to do</Text> in order stop being a porn addict.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is a bit like saying: &ldquo;Hey buddy, you have a severe problem, but I won&rsquo;t actually tell you how to address it&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>&ldquo;However what I&rsquo;ll do instead is make you increasingly aware of it, so that you feel compelled to do something about it, even though I can&rsquo;t actually help you to change.&rdquo;</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which really is of no help to you, regardless of how useful their information is at describing what your problems are.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Ultimately, there were two kinds of resources that I frequently came across:</Text>

<View style={hrul}/>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Incomplete advice from existing porn addicts, usually in the form of forum posts. Which were desperately hopeful at best.</Text></Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Scientific descriptions of porn addiction is and how it affects various aspects of our mind.</Text></Text>

<View style={hrul__bottom}/>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, while it&rsquo;s great to understand what happens under the hood from a scientific point of view.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In no way does that actually help you deal with the day-to-day of being a porn addict, and in no way does it help dealing with being a porn addict any easier.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>So lieu of all this, I decided to create NeverFap Deluxe.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>NeverFap has one very clear purpose that other methods lack:</Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}><b>To help you successfully overcome porn addiction.</b></Text></Text>

<Text style={p}>And thus easily overcome porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The reason why NeverFap works is because it is built around verifiable steps and practices, which actively change the way you feel and think on a daily basis.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Using these practices, I have personally overcome porn addiction to a point that I literally do not think about porn at all.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In addition, the NeverFap method of overcoming porn addiction has been built around Five Fundamental Principles that relate to my own life personally.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which serve to help you not only gain a better understand yourself, but also cut through the denial of being a porn addict.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Porn is not the problem</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>Aside from the fact that NeverFap is a complete solution that aims to take you from porn addict to regular human being.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I also believe NeverFap takes a very unique approach towards addressing porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You see, I maintain a very strong belief that porn addiction has very little to do with porn itself.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Understandably, watching and masturbating to porn is an incredibly addictive behaviour.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However this doesn&rsquo;t explain why some people aren&rsquo;t severe porn addicts in the same way that were are. Much in the same way that some people are not addicted to alcohol in the same that others may be.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And this is precisely where I believe scientific descriptions of porn addiction break down in terms of their usefulness at helping us overcome porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Sure. It&rsquo;s interesting to understand how porn addiction works, but it still doesn&rsquo;t quite explain why some people are absolutely obsessed with it.</Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>Which is to say that I don&rsquo;t believe porn is the underlying issue as to why we are addicted to porn</Text>.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Rather, I believe that porn addicts are addicted to porn because of some sort of fundamental misunderstanding that they have subscribed to, which they haven&rsquo;t yet figured out.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Not only is this a reflection of my own experiences with battling porn addiction, however is a reflection of the actual practices and solutions out there which work to help us address porn addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>What are we misunderstanding?</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>When you think about it, no one ever wants to be addicted.</Text>

<Text style={p}>No one wants to self-harm and pursue behaviours which cause them suffering and misery.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The only reason they do, often inspite of trying everything in their power not to, is due to this internal misunderstanding.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In some cases, this misunderstanding can be due to a limiting belief they have about their own ability to overcome porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In other cases, they may simply not have the mental capacity to influence their emotions in order to prevent cravings, usually due to lack of practice with meditation and perspective exercises.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In most cases, it&rsquo;s a combination of a number of factors, which they simply haven&rsquo;t figured out yet.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>This is why I came up with the Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap, to help guide people towards understanding exactly where they may be going wrong.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Perhaps what I like most about NeverFap is how it&rsquo;s designed to always provide you with a path forward.</Text>

<Text style={p}>When you&rsquo;re a porn addict, almost everything is confusing.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You doubt yourself. You second-guess what you&rsquo;re experiencing. And even though you may know you&rsquo;re doing the right thing, your emotions may be fighting you and telling you to do otherwise.</Text>

<Text style={p}>With NeverFap there&rsquo;s always an opportunity to try and figure out where you went wrong, and figure out exactly where you&rsquo;re at and how to address your weak points.</Text>

<Text style={p}>After all, at the end of the day overcoming porn addiction is nothing more than a skill, and it&rsquo;s a skill you can gain through practice.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The more you practice, the more you build up your confidence and your ability to control how you feel about yourself, and eventually you&rsquo;ll be able to fully control whatever outcomes you desire.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because I&rsquo;ve done it using this very same method, and you can too.</Text>

<Text style={p}>That&rsquo;s my guarantee.</Text>
