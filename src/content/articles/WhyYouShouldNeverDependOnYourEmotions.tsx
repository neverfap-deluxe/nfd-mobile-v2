<Text style={p}>One thing that porn addicts are more-than familiar with is this concept of hope and despair.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The hope that comes from the initial excitement of starting their porn recovery process.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And the complete despair that comes from breaking down a week later, when their urge to watch porn becomes unbearable and they decide to relapse.</Text>

<Text style={p}>A cycle which seems to repeat time and time again.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>What I want to do in this article is explain the dynamics of this cycle.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>As well as explain how you can put it to an end.</Text>

<Text style={p}>If you think about the key thing which defines these types of cycles, it&rsquo;s really a combination of expectation and emotion.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Expectation being our understanding that, &ldquo;This is the correct thing to do moving forward, and of course this time will be different&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Emotion being that push which convinces us that what we&rsquo;re experiencing must be true.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>After all, positive emotions never lie, right?</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>And when you combine those two factors together, what you get is a cocktail of mania so strong, that nothing we do or say can convince us otherwise.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We&rsquo;re excited. We&rsquo;re motivated.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In part, because we&rsquo;re feeling so low that we couldn&rsquo;t possibly think of anything better than to actually do something to change.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So although nothing has actually changed in that moment, we feel as if something&rsquo;s changed.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>We feel as if we're already there.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Even though it&rsquo;s just our emotions making us feel that way.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And even though nothing has actually changed in terms of meaningful actions to actually develop self-control and healthy coping mechanisms.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Then what happens is that these emotions eventually fade as the hype dies away.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We find ourselves vulnerable since those very emotions which we&rsquo;ve relied on are now telling us that we really want to watch porn.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>And then we relapse and start and whole charade again.</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>Perhaps the most common example of this is when we use something like fear to try and motivate us.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We fear the consequences of that feeling of failure if we were to relapse. We fear not achieving our life ambitions due to the effects of porn on our life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Fear which inevitably becomes craving, which becomes fear, which becomes craving, and I&rsquo;m sure you get the drift.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So what&rsquo;s the alternative?</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>The alternative is to develop proper self-control over our mind.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>The kind of self-control that allows us to dictate what we think, how we feel, as well as detach ourselves from these aspects so we don&rsquo;t take them personally.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The kind of self-control you may believe is impossible.</Text>

<Text style={p}>After all, you may be under the impression that what you&rsquo;ve been doing this whole time has been &lsquo;self-control&rsquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>When in actual fact, chasing our emotions in this fashion could not be further from actual self-control itself.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Self-control is not reliant on how we feel in any way.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>So anytime we pursue any actions or behaviours based on emotion, we essentially train our minds to embrace this instability.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And over time, we eventually create this habitual understanding that our emotions are truly representative of what we&rsquo;re capable of.</Text>

<Text style={p}>As opposed to this idea that our mind is in control of our emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Hopefully this article helps you better understand exactly what happens in our minds when we pursue this cycle of emotion.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In terms of moving forward, I highly recommend checking out our range of comprehensive NeverFap Practices which are designed to help you regain control over your mind.</Text>
