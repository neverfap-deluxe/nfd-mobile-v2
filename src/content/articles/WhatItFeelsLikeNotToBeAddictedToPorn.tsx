          What It Feels Like Not To Be Addicted To Porn

        <Text style={content__date}>2019-04-14</Text>
        <Text style={p}>One thing which people often ask me is:</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          What does it feel like not to be addicted to porn?
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          And it&rsquo;s an interesting question, because it&rsquo;s something I
          often think about and I think I&rsquo;ve finally found a way to convey
          this message accurately.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          If I had to provide an appropriate analogy which summarises what it
          feels like not to be addicted to porn, I would ask you to think back
          to when you were 7 years&rsquo; old.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Now, for most people this is a rather distant memory.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I personally remember very little about what my life was like back
          then, although if I had to approximate I would say that I was in Grade
          2 and that I had a relatively simple life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I don&rsquo;t remember any particular details, the people in it, nor
          is it something which really evokes any sort of emotion, regret or
          anything.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It just was a period of time within which I existed, no different to
          my existence now.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Well, that memory kind of sums up how I also feel about my previous
          porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is to say that my porn addiction is a lot like a distant memory
          to me.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          While I remember the attachment and depression that resulted from it,
          I don&rsquo;t remember a whole lot of the specifics in terms of why I
          did it, nor even what it felt like.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t really have any feelings towards it, since
          I haven&rsquo;t experienced the guilt, shame and sadness that arose
          from my habit in quite a very long time.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Instead, you could say that it feels no different to being 7
          years&rsquo; old.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          From a process point of view, it's actually quite astounding to
          understand why it's all a distant memory to me.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          For starters, I&rsquo;m obviously not watching porn.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          But let&rsquo;s really dig into what this actually means, because
          being a porn addict is so much more than just &lsquo;watching
          porn&rsquo; and turning into a pile of inconspicuous jelly.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          From a time perspective, I&rsquo;m no longer spending hours everyday
          looking at porn.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which not only means physically watching porn, but also dedicating
          time to watch porn which could otherwise be spent on more productive
          pursuits.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Another aspect which people don&rsquo;t consider is the mental
          overhead of planning and organising that time as well.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In my case, it meant consciously thinking about how I could masturbate
          to porn without my partner knowing, which not only affected my
          behaviour around her, but my mood as well if I hadn&rsquo;t orgasmed
          in a while.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          At it's worst, it was completely controlling my behaviour to a point
          of absolute obsession.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          There were times where I used to even do it at work, because I&rsquo;d
          had a bad day or I was feeling particularly desperate.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I remember when I was working in a very confined office, I went as far
          as to walk to the local library so I could use my laptop and get a
          better image, rather than with my phone which I could afford to sneak
          into the toilet.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You know, much like when I was absolutely obsessed with video games as
          a 7 year old, to a point where I would cry if my mother didn&rsquo;t
          let me play.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, it&rsquo;s funny to look back at these memories and
          certainly, as awkward as it is to admit some of these things, because
          I haven&rsquo;t relived these behaviours in such a long time, it no
          longer affects me personally.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Certainly, the biggest thing that's changed is my mental state.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          The behaviours that arose from porn addiction aside, the thing which
          I&rsquo;ve noticed most is the improvement in my energy and mental
          state.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You know that post-relapse dopamine brain-fog fun-land of hell?
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Well, that&rsquo;s truly a thing of the past and my mind is in a
          constant state of being level and clear, especially with my daily
          routine of meditation help balance things out.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I&rsquo;m no longer irrationally depressed and my emotions are no
          longer tipping up and down, like a bunch of ADHD kids on a see-saw.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>But wow, what a difference.</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          I distinctly remember that feeling of calm I felt when I first started
          meditating.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          It was mind-boggling. It was like I&rsquo;d finally felt peace and
          control for the first time in my porn recovery journey.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It was at that point that I knew I would never be addicted to porn
          again, because I&rsquo;d finally discovered a way to effortlessly tame
          my mind.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And that&rsquo;s another thing which a lot of people don&rsquo;t
          realise: When you overcome your porn addiction, life actually becomes
          easy and enjoyable.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because your emotions aren&rsquo;t all over the place, it becomes
          really easy to commit to your goals, and an amazing side effect of
          this is that you actually become happy.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Like, not obsessive happy or manic happy, but just genuinely happy.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          The kind of happiness that doesn&rsquo;t ask anything of you, and
          which makes you feel completely at peace with yourself.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          While it&rsquo;s been a long and arduous journey getting to this
          point, I can definitely say that once you experience all these
          wonderful things, you&rsquo;ll never want to go back.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, the hard part is getting to a point where you finally do
          feel this kind of peace, which is why we emphasise the importance of
          practice and consistency.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          As long as you stick with the process, you will absolutely succeed
          with your goal of overcoming porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s also part of the reason why I&rsquo;ve put so much effort
          into crafting this website so that the process can make intuitive
          sense to you.
