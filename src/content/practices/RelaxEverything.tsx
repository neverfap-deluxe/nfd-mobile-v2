          This exercise is incredibly effective, especially for those new to
          awareness.

        <Text style={p}>
          I mean, I&rsquo;d go as far as to say that all exercises are
          effective. It&rsquo;s just that some exercises a lot simpler to
          execute than others.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          One thing you&rsquo;ll notice as you trawl this website, is that there
          are a range of different exercises which all seem quite similar to
          each other.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          This includes Slow Down Time where we attempt to slow down and speed
          up reality, as well as Stop Absolutely Everything You&rsquo;re Doing
          where we attempt to shut down our mind completely, as if we&rsquo;ve
          consciously flicked off a switch at the back of our minds.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The idea is that with different perspectives, we can learn to
          understand ourselves and our conscious experience with a more open
          mind, as well as embrace different ways of thinking.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So that we can effectively challenge the denial that comes with being
          an addict.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          With <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Relax Everything</Text>,
          what we&rsquo;re essentially trying to do is learn to relax and let
          go, as opposed to say, consciously manipulate our interpretation of
          reality or make judgements about how we&rsquo;re feeling.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s a skill which will allow us to effectively deal with our
          urges and uncomfortable feelings and emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          An important thing to keep in mind with these awareness exercises is
          that while we&rsquo;re ultimately aiming to develop hard skills,
          it&rsquo;s also important for us to focus on the introspection aspect
          of these exercises as well.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In other words, how these different exercises make us feel as we
          practice them.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          From an introspection point of view, we&rsquo;re not necessarily
          trying to &lsquo;achieve&rsquo; anything per-say.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Instead, what we&rsquo;re merely attempting to do is observe and
          develop our ability to view ourselves with a more open mind.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Essentially, it&rsquo;s a very effective way to learn mastery over
          your thoughts and emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So whenever you&rsquo;re doing these kinds of exercises, remember to
          always try and guage how you feel. Does the exercise make you feel
          frustrated? Do you think anything at all?
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4} />

        <Text style={h4}>
          If you skip this step, then you'll gain very little from these
          exercises because you won't be actively engaging your brain.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          And if you don&rsquo;t engage your brain, then you won&rsquo;t engage
          in physical changes that take place between your neural connections,
          and subscequently you won&rsquo;t be truly changing in the sense of
          conscious realisation.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>So ask yourself when doing the exercise:</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Do you feel more comfortable when you relax? Is there anything you
          don&rsquo;t like about relaxing? How does it compare to other
          awareness exercises? Do you even understand what it means to be
          relaxed at all?
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Remember, this is a process of self-discovery.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>There are no right or wrong answers.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>There is only what you feel and how you perceive.</Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          For this exercise, what we want to do is relax and you can do this
          whenever you want.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I personally find it&rsquo;s quite effective to engage in this
          activity while doing something, because it&rsquo;s arguably easier to
          relax when you&rsquo;re in a non-relaxed state, as opposed to sitting
          silently in a chair.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>So what does it mean to relax?</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Well, let&rsquo;s start with some of the physical attributes.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Relaxing from a physical perspective means letting go of all the
          tension in your body. It means slowing your mental pace, as well as
          taking things easy.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          If I had to describe the essence of relaxation, I would say that
          it&rsquo;s about experiencing life without obligation or care. You
          just are.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It means not worrying about anything, because you know what?
          There&rsquo;s simply no obligation to worry, because when you are
          relaxed you have no responsibilty to anything.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Again, I urge you to remember that this is a process of
          self-discovery, and that I&rsquo;m not asking you to permanently
          dissolve into a puddle of jelly.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          These are short bursts of perspective I am asking you to engage in
          throughout the day, in order to develop a more open mind.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Certainly, while I can describe what relaxation is all day, unless if
          you actually attempt to practice it, then you simply won&rsquo;t learn
          what it actually is, nor be able to effectively use it when required.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          One key thing to understand about relaxation is that it&rsquo;s a
          feeling, so if you can&rsquo;t feel it on demand, then you won&rsquo;t
          be able to cope when you find yourself in a situation where you feel
          compelled to watch porn or do something equally self-destructive.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In other words, relaxation is one of the many health coping mechanisms
          we will be developing in order to help us cope with life in a more
          effective way.
