<Text style={p}>This is an exercise which porn addicts benefit from greatly, due to the way it changes your visual perception of reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So let&rsquo;s get crackin&rsquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The intention behind a lot of these exercises is to assist you in breaking down what you understand of your mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The word &ldquo;understand&rdquo; of course, meaning the conglomerate of knowledge you&rsquo;ve gained and learned up until now.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Part of the reason why we want to break down your understanding of life and reality, is because what you currently &ldquo;know&rdquo; is largely counter-intuitive.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>You see, what you "understand" is part of the reason why you're addicted to porn.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>What you currently &ldquo;understand&rdquo; is that you really want to watch porn.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What you &ldquo;understand&rdquo; is that you don&rsquo;t have the self-control not to watch porn, and that it&rsquo;s a lot easier if you just relapse and watch porn.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And certainly, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I mean, it&rsquo;s what you understand. You can&rsquo;t help what you&rsquo;ve been taught up until now, it&rsquo;s all your brain knows.</Text>

<Text style={p}>On the other hand, it&rsquo;s also perfectly fine to change your understanding of reality so that you can allow yourself the opportunity to overcome your own porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is exactly what this website aims to do.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For today&rsquo;s exercise, what we want to do is break down our visual understanding of reality, and how that relates to our own thoughts and feelings.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is to say that we want to separate our thoughts and feelings from what we&rsquo;re actually seeing in front of us.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>As human beings, we tend to attach meaning and value to that which we can physically see.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>It could be a trinket that belongs to your family which evokes emotions of pride and belonging.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It could be the sight of a McDonalds in the distance, and the memories that place evokes. It could even be something more conceptual, like a particular scene within a movie.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And with this exercise we want to learn to separate these two elements, because what we see is not what we feel.</Text>

<Text style={p}>They are two completely separate elements which we&rsquo;ve learnt to associate together, no different to watching porn and all the feelings associated with it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Both empowering and overwhelmingly negative.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Think of them as being two completely different sensations. The sensation of seeing, and the sensation of feeling.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So why is this important?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, let&rsquo;s look at porn addiction for example.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For porn addicts porn isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;two people having sex&rdquo;. Rather, it&rsquo;s a complex relationship which evokes a whole range of feelings and emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Porn is also feeling immense guilt for having relapsed, porn is feeling completely empty and drained on the inside, porn is the shame of lying about our habit to our friends and family.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Yet when you think about it, porn really is nothing more than &ldquo;two people having sex&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Sure, it&rsquo;s something that a lot of humans find destructively addictive, but it&rsquo;s hard to deny that from a visual perspective, there really is nothing that awful about it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>With this in mind, what this exercise attempts to do is help you come to the understand that porn is simply &ldquo;two people having sex&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And the way we do this is by separating what we feel and what we see into two different categories.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because currently we may have developed a habit of jumbling the two together, and not quite realising all the steps our mind makes internal when jumping to the conclusion of &ldquo;I really want to watch porn&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>One thing to notice is that this exercise may seem incredibly similar to Dissolve Your Visual Perception Of Reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Both exercises focus on manipulating our visual understanding in some way, however both exercises do completely different things.</Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Dissolve Your Visual Perception Of Reality</Text> attempts to completely absolve our understanding of reality, while this exercise attempts to rearrange our understanding of it.</Text>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>For this exercise, what we want to do is look at some things, and try and figure out the difference between what we&rsquo;re seeing and what we&rsquo;re feeling.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We can do this sitting down at home, or anywhere really. Observe what you see. Observe what you feel.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It could be a building. It could be another person. I tend to do this exercise using everyday objects, although sentimental objects can work well too.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Especially objects that we&rsquo;ve kept around the house for a while, that you&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time with. (for example, it could be a video game console)</Text>

<Text style={p}>Can you distinguish any difference between the object and the feeling? What are those differences? Is there even a difference?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Is there any feeling at all, and are you responsible for creating that feeling or is it the object which is responsible for how you feel</Text>

<Text style={p}>Play around with it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Try this exercises in different areas and different places. See if you can discover any common themes.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The world truly is your oyster ^^</Text>
