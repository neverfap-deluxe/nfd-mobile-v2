          Learning to focus our attention is an important skill.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          However, I would also argue that it&rsquo;s quite an advanced skill
          that should only be attempted once you feel more comfortable being
          aware in general.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In fact, it&rsquo;s an exercise which builds upon Observe Your Senses
          so it makes sense to master that first.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Otherwise, we can truly struggle with this exercise, and more often
          than not when people attempt to learn this exercise first, it almost
          always leads to more confusion than clarity.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So please do not proceed until you&rsquo;ve mastered more fundamental
          awareness exercises.

        <Text style={h2}>What is focus?</Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          The funny thing about focus is that it&rsquo;s a bit of a paradox, at
          least according to conventional wisdom.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          A lot of people treat focus as if it&rsquo;s supposed to be this kind
          of intense period of concentration, which is designed to consume all
          you energy and attention.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In reality, effective focus is not like that and cannot come from
          tensing up and trying &lsquo;really hard&rsquo; to get into that
          mental zone.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Instead, effective focus comes from being calm and relaxed with a
          clear intention in mind.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          I mean, I&rsquo;m sure anyone could maintain intense focus by trying
          &lsquo;really hard&rsquo; however it certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be
          effective in the sense of being in control.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Ultimately, you cannot focus effectively if you&rsquo;re spending all
          your mental energy on creating an environment in which you feel
          comfortable to focus.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because then you&rsquo;re left with significantly less energy to
          actually focus, and instead it leaves you incredibly vulnerable and
          quite ironically, without focus.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Definitely, not fun.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          As stated earlier, if I had to describe what focus is.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          I would say that it's nothing more than awareness with a clear
          intention.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is to say that it&rsquo;s the same thing as being aware in the
          traditional sense (i.e. observation), only now you&rsquo;re choosing
          an intention outside of simply being aware of your senses.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          This is why I say that you must first learn to master basic awareness
          before moving onto these kinds of exercises.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because it actually requires more skill to remain calm and aware,
          while also selectively focusing on a certain aspect of your awareness.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which people generally find more difficult than simply being aware of
          all their sense.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In essence, it&rsquo;s easier to be fully attuned to all your senses
          at once without focus, than it is to be fully attuned to just one of
          your senses
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Simply because there&rsquo;s less overhead.</Text>

        <Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          There are essentially two key steps towards performing this exercise.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          First, relax and put yourself into a state of unconditional awareness,
          as per the instructions in Observe Your Senses.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In this state of mind, you should have completely emptied your mind
          and become fully attuned to your senses.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Then, once you have achieved this, attempt to place your attention on
          a very particular aspect of your awareness.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It could be something visual, like a lamp or a door. It could be a
          sound that is occurring in the background. It could be a physical
          sensation that you&rsquo;re experiencing in your body.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Play around with it and see where your mind takes you.
