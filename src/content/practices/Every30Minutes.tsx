          The idea behind this exercise is to help you develop awareness
          throughout your day on an interval basis.

        <Text style={p}>
          Essentially, the intention behind{' '}
          <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Every 30 Minutes</Text> is to
          help keep a constant gauge of what you&rsquo;re doing.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And by doing so, gain a deeper understanding of awareness and routine,
          in particular of your own life and how you play it out each day.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Routine is a very important part of the recovery process, and this
          exercise is a way to streamline that process, or at least get you
          thinking about it in a meaningful way.

          In addition, it&rsquo;s a wonderful way to engage your brain, which is
          really half the battle when it comes to addressing porn addiction.

          Essentially, your aim with this exercise is to keep a mental timer
          every 30 minutes, and to record or even just acknowledge what
          you&rsquo;re doing within in that moment.

        <Text style={p}>
          In order for this to be effective, you will not be using an alarm to
          do this.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Instead, you will be using your own intuition, and then checking the
          clock to see what time it is, and whether you should record what
          you&rsquo;re doing yet.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The whole idea is that we want to develop this mental timeline
          ourselves, and the only way we can do this is through practice.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Put simply, an alarm is not a substitute for your own conscious
          awareness, which is what we are attempting to develop.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Personally I find it helps to do this exercise starting at a time like
          8:00am in order to make it easier to track those 30 minute segment.

        <Text style={p}>
          Although, you&rsquo;re free to do whatever interval works best for
          you. For example, you might want to experiment with hourly intervals
          instead.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          (although I tend to find the longer the duration, the harder it is for
          people starting out)
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In addition, I want to add that this is can be a real tough one!
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Although it sounds easy in practice, humans tend to forget. It&rsquo;s
          a bit like when we feel distracted during meditation, and we find
          ourselves thinking about something irrelevant.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Sometimes we can have a hard time maintaining our conscious awareness,
          however this is precisely why we&rsquo;re practicing this exercise.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>So we can focus on what&rsquo;s important.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>Our mental health.</Text>
