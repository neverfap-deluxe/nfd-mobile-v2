          <b>Where Do You Touch?</b> is another classic awareness exercise which
          is designed to help you develop focus and attention.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          By &ldquo;classic&rdquo; I mean it&rsquo;s another variation of the
          tried-and-true &ldquo;pay attention to X thing throughout the
          day&rdquo; that I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen in abundance on this
          website.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Well, the reason why I write so many of them is because they&rsquo;re
          incredibly effective at getting you to think about awareness in a
          unique way.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          In essence, because this is what you should be doing with your
          attention anyway.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is to say that you should be practicing awareness in everything
          you do, and that this exercise is merely a shortcut to having you
          eventually do this automatically.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Awareness is important because it&rsquo;s what allows you to
          understand and learn your own behaviours, not only to change them, but
          also to enhance them.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          By practicing awareness in any capacity, we train our ability to catch
          ourselves doing silly things, like watching porn when we&rsquo;re
          feeling stressed.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And instead, consciously decide within that moment, to replace that
          unhealthy coping mechanism with a healthy coping mechanism instead.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The more we practice this, the more it will help us to think in terms
          of using our awareness in an empowering way, and eventually it will
          become second-nature to us.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Overtime we will become more aware of all our behaviours and quirks,
          and this is when we will develop full-control over our lives.

          In this exercise we&rsquo;re going to be paying attention to our body
          and how it interacts with touch.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Essentially, I want you to take note of whenever you&rsquo;re touching
          something.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, I&rsquo;m currently using my fingers to tap against this
          keyboard in order to type these words.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And yet although it&rsquo;s something I spend most my day doing,
          it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;ve ever really thought about.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Well, that&rsquo;s precisely the problem we&rsquo;re trying to
          address. To begin thinking about behaviours which your brain has
          subconsciously ignored for decades.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, your response to masturbate daily as a way to deal with
          certain feelings and emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In addition, an important aspect of this exercise is to pay attention
          to the feeling of touch as well.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          What does it feel like when you bump into something? Does it hurt when
          you touch something? Does it feel hot or cold? Does it evoke emotion?
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Only by becoming aware of our senses can we not only learn to better
          understand how they relate to our conscious experience.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          However it can help us to better control the experience itself once we
          become aware of our behaviours related to touch.
